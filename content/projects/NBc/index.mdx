<h4>About project</h4>

<br/>

Artificial intelligence subject task turned into research project in order to check effectiveness of Naive Bayes classifier against two methods of returning data to training(TRN) system - bootstrap and monte carlo. Since idea of making scientific publication to this subject came later, published code is not that universal that I would like it to be. More information about project can be found at GitHub and publication is available <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2571/CSP2019_paper_17.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Thanks to ðŸŽ“ dr hab. Piotr Artiemjew for help and motivation on solving met problems.
