  Expanded and open source project of repository documentation designer made in JavaScript and published on github pages. Unique solution in comparement to other WYSIWYG tools. This one favours more clicking than writing manually syntax and has personal ideas. It received 16 updates between 04.03.2020 and 23.10.2020. EzGitDoc introduction can be found <a href="https://os-expected.github.io/EzGitDoc-documentation/docs#about" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p class="text-justify">
  In October 2020, due to the project expansion, I've decided to move documentation to separated page which was created in Docusaurus2(React). Click <a href="https://os-expected.github.io/EzGitDoc-documentation/" target="_blank">here</a> to see it.
