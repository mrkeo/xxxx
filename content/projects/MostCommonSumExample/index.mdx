<h4>About project</h4>

<br/>

Script primarly made in Python to return most even or uneven sum of given size and list. Starting from number on index = 0, it takes size - 1 numbers from sorted array and looks after number which gives most even or uneven sum. If in single iteration there won't be any matching number, program will take next numbers starting from index + 1 and look again for last matching number.
