  One of the very first projects I've took. I had to implement three-rotor Engima. I've stumbled with it because I was making first steps in programming, however I'm somehow satisfied with the results I've achieved. Apart from Enigma implementation I've also added "detective mode" that shows how program works. Gif is from version that had one crucial problem - coding first letter into itself which I resolved in v1.65. <a href="https://youtu.be/G2_Q9FoD-oQ" target="_blank">This video</a> helped me understand how Enigma works ðŸ™‚
