<h4>About project</h4>

<p class="text-justify">
  Small script primarly made in Python to validate if given date range doesn't overlap ones stored in for e.g. database. Provided example concerns room renting. Image below shows how program is expected to react on each attempt(A1-A8) when database stores rents R1, R2 and R3. Green border of the attempt indicates that given date range doesn't overlap while red does.
