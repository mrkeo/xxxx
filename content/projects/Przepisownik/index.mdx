<h4>About project</h4>

<br/>

<p class="text-justify">
    Project came out as a personal need to store recipes which can be easily accessed through the Internet instead of sending txt file with links on each change. By the way, that days I was also using Windows Phone system and liked tiles sysem so much that I wanted to use it for Przepisownik 2016 and found grid.js library. Page is still running and can be viewed <a href="http://przepisownik2016.opx.pl/" target="_blank">here</a> but since it is on free hosting, expect adverts if you're not using advert blocking software ðŸš«ðŸ™‚
