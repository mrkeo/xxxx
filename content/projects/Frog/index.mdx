<h4>About project</h4>

<br/>

My first project on GitHub for object oriented programming college classes optional task. Projekt Frog was made in WinForms and is based on popular classic called Frogger. Project includes two levels, fatigue system(frog can't move if endurance drops to 0 and needs to rest) and has local 2 players coop mode.
