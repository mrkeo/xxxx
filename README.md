### How to use?

Clone or fork, overwrite GraphQL queries after `npm install` and adjust to personal needs ðŸ˜‹

#### Important note

Since shadowing GraphQL queries results in compilation warnings(can be ommited but produces annoying text ðŸ˜„) I would suggest to overwrite query files and gatsby-node.js from your node_modules after using `npm install` command. How to do it?

1. (optional) Copy and update path given below, according to your repo location <br/> `{DRIVE}:\{DIR1}\{REPOSITORY}\node_modules\@lekoarts\gatsby-theme-emma-core` 
2. Use it to quickly go to the destination or jump there from clicking from dir to dir =)
3. Copy content of these files(<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trolit/trolit.github.io/storage/npm/gatsby-node.js">gatsy-node.js</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trolit/trolit.github.io/storage/npm/project-query.tsx">project-query.tsx</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trolit/trolit.github.io/storage/npm/projects-query.tsx">projects-query.tsx</a>) and overwrite them after running `npm install`.
5. `gatsby develop` project
