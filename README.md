#### Note

Since shadowing GraphQL queries results in compilation warnings(can be ommited but produces annoying text ðŸ˜„) I would suggest to overwrite query files and gatsby-node.js from your node_modules after using `npm install` command. How to do it?

1. (optional) Copy and update path given below, according to your repo location <br/> `{DRIVE}:\{DIR1}\{REPOSITORY}\node_modules\@lekoarts\gatsby-theme-emma-core` 
2. Use it to quickly go to the destination or jump there from clicking from dir to dir =)
3. Click on links: gatsy-node.js, ... They will redirect you to raw files in GitHub.
4. Overwrite files created by `npm install`.
5. `gatsby develop` project
